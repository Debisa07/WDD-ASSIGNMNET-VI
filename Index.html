        <div class="procontainer" id="pro">

            <div class="protext">

                <p>I am Debisa Abebe a Software engineering student at AAiT. I'm from Ethiopia which is a country full
                    of
                    culture and
                    history which dates back hundreeds and thousends of years. I love eating and hanging out with my
                    friends.
                    'm currently a software engineering student and I gained some skills through out my school years
                    which I
                    intend to word
                    on now and for sure in the future.</p>

        <p> To make a living is one and major reason for me to do this. plus as said before it's interesting in a way
            you get to
            see
            things you do right away plus you'll in most cases just need a computer and some softwares to work with.My
            first
            programming language to get a grasp of is python. it's a relatively new language but has been utilized
            intensively so I'm glad I got the skill and I want to build upon it further more since programming is ever
            growing
            thing
            and there is always something to learn.</p>
        <br>
        <p>That leading me to my next point, one should love him/her self fiest before thinking to love others.The love
            and
            appreciation we got for our selves is what pushes us to live to our fullest and keep us from doing self
            destructing
            things that most people do in their day to day life..</p>
        <h3>Interested in</h3>
        <p>Now codding is one part of my life. I will be codding whenever I got free time. Coddind webpages is very
            interesting
            and
            powerful tool. You can create lots of impressive display using it.
            I always push my self to be able to learn new things. I don't enjoy reading but I try to take some other
            measures to
            learn like videos audio books and some others. I've always wanted to be an acadamia so I'll always push
            forward to
            achieve it.
        </p> <br>
        <p>Who doesn't like sport. I love sport specially football and basketball. Watching football matches is one of
            the most
            interesting yet goosebumps giving exxperiance especially when my team is in the field. By the way I'm a big
            fan of
            tothenam.

            I spend much of my time on the internet. I like surfing on the web as most would agree. And now days It's
            become
            mandatory for me to use it for study and also for the soul purpose of relaxation. And youtube is the major I
            use
            next to
            stackoverflow</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Movies are the things I ran to whenever I dont have much to do. It's fun especially when it's comedy. Ilove
            comedy
            movies.

            I dont need to say much about food. It's our basic need plus it's delicois. so I enjoy eating. Thats why
            it's in my
            hobby list....funny right.

            That leading me to my next point, one should love him/her self fiest before thinking to love others.The love
            and
            appreciation we got for our selves is what pushes us to live to our fullest and keep us from doing self
            destructing
            things that most people do in their day to day life.</p>
