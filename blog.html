                                to learn and work with them
                                .us
                                we all know the language that we uses in now time are many .but the best way is be

                            <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by
                                Guido van Rossum and first
                                released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
                                notable use of significant
                                whitespace...
                                Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write
                                clear, logical code for small and
                                large-scale projects.
                                Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming
                                paradigms, including procedural,
                                object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries
                                included" language due to its
                                comprehensive standard library.

                                Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based,
                                object-oriented, and
                                specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is
                                intended to let application
                                developers “write once, run anywhere” (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on
                                all platforms that support
                                Java
                                without the need for recompilation.
                                For example, you can write and compile a Java program on UNIX and run it on Microsoft
                                Windows, Macintosh, or UNIX
                                machine without any modifications to the source code. WORA is achieved by compiling a
                                Java program into an
                                intermediate
                                language called bytecode.

                                current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a

                                JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how
