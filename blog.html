        <p> This programing languages are popular in our programming world .i highly recommend you to learn and work with them
            .us
            we all know the language that we uses in now time are many .but the best way is be selective and uses .</p>

        <h3>1, Python</h3>
        <img src="http://allvectorlogo.com/img/2017/09/python-logo.png" alt="" width="300px" height="150px">
        <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first
            released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant
            whitespace.
            Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and
            large-scale projects.
            Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural,
            object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its
            comprehensive standard library.

        <P>
            Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and
            specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application
            developers “write once, run anywhere” (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support
            Java
            without the need for recompilation.
            For example, you can write and compile a Java program on UNIX and run it on Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, or UNIX
            machine without any modifications to the source code. WORA is achieved by compiling a Java program into an
            intermediate
            language called bytecode.

        <p>HTML5 is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a
            markup-based pattern to it.
            HTML5 was the fifth and current major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The
            current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser
            vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
            HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,with a major update and "W3C Recommendation"

        <p>JavaScript
            JavaScript® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class
            functions,
            and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.
            It is
            a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and
            functional programming styles.
            JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the
            occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for
            controlling
            web page behavior.

        <p>The correct title of this article is C# (programming language). The substitution of the # is due to technical
            restrictions C# (pronounced see sharp, like the musical note C♯, but written with the number sign) is a
            general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative,
            declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.
